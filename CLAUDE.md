# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

One unified site at `outli.live` (GitHub Pages, CNAME). The marketing homepage is the entry point; legal and support pages are integrated sub-pages.

## Tech Stack

- Vanilla HTML5 + CSS + minimal JS only
- No UI frameworks, no Tailwind, no build step, no package manager
- Mobile-first responsive design
- No analytics/tracking scripts
- Prefer CSS for behavior (`scroll-behavior: smooth`) over JS where possible
- Deploy: `git push` to `main` → GitHub Pages live instantly

## File Structure

- `index.html` — Marketing homepage (entry point)
- `privacy.html` — Privacy Policy (GDPR-compliant, renamed from `index.html`)
- `termsofuse.html` — Terms of Use
- `support.html` — Support page with FAQ
- `styles.css` — Shared stylesheet (common styles extracted from inline `<style>` blocks)
- `outli_homepage_build_brief.md` — Spec for the marketing homepage

## Architecture & Conventions

- Shared styles live in `styles.css`, linked from all pages
- Page-specific styles can live in `<style>` tags within each file
- Legal page navbar includes a "Home" link to `index.html`
- Homepage footer links to `privacy.html` (not `index.html`)
- When updating legal content, keep the `Last updated:` date at the top of the file in sync
- All pages share the same iOS-inspired aesthetic (`-apple-system` font stack, `#007aff` link color)
- Note: CNAME must be updated from `legal.outli.live` → `outli.live` when going live
